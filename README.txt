Running current code:
This project is structured as a maven project which is supported by all the major IDEs by importing the yoda/yoda/pom.xml file .
It requires the Java 8 language level and SDK.

The easiest way to view the code and run a demonstration of some dialog management test cases is to import the pom.xml file into IntelliJ or Eclipse and run the test program: 
src/test/java/edu/cmu/sv/TestActionSelection.java .
